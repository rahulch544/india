Why Go Lang ?
Infrastructure changed lot, 1. Multicore process 2. Cloud Infrastructure 3. Big Networking

Scalable & Distributed , dynamic, More Capacity

 requirement for GOLANG:

 1. To Support mulit threading 
 2. To prevent Concurrency
 3. Multiple users updating the same process

 Bulit In Concurrency Lang: C++, Java, GO Language
 Concurrency Mechanism is complex code and expesive and slow in c++ and Java code
 Concurrency Mechanism is cheap and easy in go and was designed to run on multiple cores.

 Main Use case:Performance, scalability application:

 Go Lang is like : Python readable syntax and performance like c++ 

 Go Lang is on backend language,

 Go Lang is fast at built and run time and requires less resource.
 Faster compliation. -> complies into single binary code file.
